Triumph was a larp inspired by *The Hunger Games*. 65 players arrived in The
Eternal City. 24 were Triumphs, to train and be shown off to the Imperium. 12
were their mentors, tasked with guiding them through the politics of the
Capital. The remainder were Citizens of the Capital, stylists and media
representatives and operators with their own plans and agendas.

The larp was played over three days, from Nov 17th to Nov 20th, 2022. The
first day was the arrival of the Triumphs at the Eternal City. The second was
training and politicking. The final day was the games themselves â€” the
Triumphs were taken to an arena where they fought to the death, with everyone
else watching and attempting to influence the outcome.

This site remains up as a archive of game policies and materials. There are
currently no plans for a rerun, although that remains a possibility.
