The organisers of *Triumph* value the safety of players, and we do not tolerate
any form of discrimination or harassment. <!--more-->

To this end, There will be a mandatory consent and safety briefing before the 
start of this game. Together we are going to look after each other and ensure 
this game happens in as safe a place as possible.

Players who do not abide by these rules will be removed from the game.

## Safety Team

We will have a dedicted Safety Team to support this larp including an external
member who is not connected to the design team. They will be announced as soon
as they are in place. Our Safety Team can be contacted before, during and
after the larp at [safety@triumphlarp.org](mailto:safety@triumphlarp.org).

## Safety Workshops

Our Safety Team will be holding mandatory safety workshops prior to commencing
the larp. These workshops will introduce our Safety Team and the various ways
they can be reached during the larp. These workshops will also cover our
safety rules and provide opportunity to ask questions and practice our safety
tools.

## Consent

All play in this game is centered around the principles of consent.  This
means that if you are in doubt, you must always ask and make sure that consent
is given. It is better to ask and negotiate ten times too often than not. Consent
is not ongoing.  If someone gives consent for an action an hour ago, that does not
mean they have given consent now.  Consent can be withdrawn at any time.  So, once
again: if in doubt, ask.

## Safety Techniques

### Tap Out

<a href="https://participationsafety.wordpress.com/2016/09/11/toolkit-the-tap-out/" target="_blank">https://<i></i>participationsafety.wordpress.com/2016/09/11/toolkit-the-tap-out/</a>

This is a non-verbal way of indicating that you are approaching your limit.
Useful, for example, if someone is looming over you, being too forceful, or
you are in other ways feeling intimidated or triggered. Tap the player twice
with 2 or more fingers as an indication that the current action must stop. If
need be tap again a bit harder, and repeat until the player notices and
responds. Play then stops. The person tapping out decides what happens next.
They may leave the scene – no questions asked. They may continue after a brief
pause, in this case everyone should tone down whatever they were doing. They
may ask for a specific alteration in play (e.g. "please don’t stand so close"
or "please don’t shout so loud") and this must be respected

### Look Down

<a href="https://participationsafety.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/toolkit-the-see-no-evil-or-lookdown/" target="_blank">https://<i></i>participationsafety.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/toolkit-the-see-no-evil-or-lookdown/</a>

This allows the player to withdraw from an area or scene. Players may at
times witness things they find disturbing or suddenly have a need to be
elsewhere; this is the means for those players to exit the scene, no questions
asked.

### OK Check In

<a href="https://participationsafety.wordpress.com/2016/09/09/toolkit-the-ok-check-in/" target="_blank">https://<i></i>participationsafety.wordpress.com/2016/09/09/toolkit-the-ok-check-in/</a>

If you see a player who looks distressed please check in. To do this without
breaking immersion we use a hand sign. The person you’re checking responds
with thumbs up (player OK), thumbs down (player not OK) or holding their hand
level (player not sure). Being unsure is treated the same as being "not OK".
It costs nothing to ask. If they need help to get to our safety room please
give this help. Conversely, if they are role playing being distressed
checking it out can then give you the opportunity to engage in play without
worry.

Be aware that being Tapped Out or someone using Look Down is not a criticism
of anyone. It is an indication of an immediate need.

We express our thanks to Johanna Koljonen for the above articles, and of
course all those before us who have worked on developing these techniques

## Physical Contact

### General Rules

All forms of physical contact require consent. If you want to hug someone,
ask them first. Give the other person time and space to agree or to say no. 
Remember no always means no, it is not open to negotiation. The same applies
if you want to get into a physical fight with another character. Always make
sure that what you propose is OK with the other player. Again, no means no.
Yes means it is OK to proceed, and at this point you negotiate if need be. 
Once negotiated and agreed, act it out, make it dramatic, let others witness
it.

### Arena Physical Contact

Physical contact/fighting in the arena between characters will in most
instances take place with a referee present. Combat will be negotiated and,
once agreed upon, it will be acted out. Our safety workshop will provide
guidelines and method for simulated combat, and provide more details on safety
within the arena.

## Spaces

### Safety Room

A safety room will be maintained within the venue during game hours. A member
of the team will be present there as a Safety Officer. If you come across
anyone in distress who needs help to get to the safety room, please assist
them or alert the Safety Officer. There will be a means of contacting a Safety
Officer outside game hours.

### Quiet Space

There will be a designated quiet out of game space. This is an off game area
and is not to be used for larping.

### Hotel Bedrooms

Hotel bedrooms are private spaces belonging to the occupants. We cannot stop
the occupants from larping in the rooms, but the occupants have absolute
authority over what takes place in their room. It is only okay to larp in the
rooms if all occupants agree it is, and any occupant has absolute authority to
ask any guest to leave.

## Alcohol and other intoxicants

This larp takes place in a hotel; there is a bar. Please be sensible, and
please respect local laws. For the safety of the rest of the participants we
will remove a person from the game if their behaviour is inappropriate.

## Hotel Rules and Open Water

Please respect hotel rules; they are there for your safety and welfare. 
Please be extra careful around open water, and remember that wet surfaces can
be slippery. We will be providing further guidance on this at our pregame
safety briefing.

## Hotel Staff

Hotel staff will at times be in the larp area, where they may be serving you
meals or drinks, or otherwise carrying out their duties. The hotel staff will
be aware that we are larping, but are not part of the larp. Please treat all
staff with politeness and respect; they are not NPCs.

## Media Teams

Our media support team will be present. They are providing the video feeds
(and more!) that we have designed to be an integral part of Triumph. There
is also a Triumph photographer who will be taking stills. These teams are not
specifically part of Triumph larp in an in game sense and are not there to be
interacted with.  These people are helping us run Triumph; please treat them
with respect.

There may be others with cameras, microphones, or other film equipment who are
part of the media circus surrounding the Triumph games. These characters should
have a visible press pass and can be interacted with as part of the larp, and 
they are fully part of the in game experience.

## Post Game Debrief

There will be a post game debrief immediately after the conclusion of the
larp. While attendance is optional, and we recognise that everyone has
different post game needs, we do encourage participation.
